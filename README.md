# Team Profile Generator

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to generate a Team Profile so as a Manager I will have quick access to my teams emails and GitHub profiles. 

## Description
Using Node.js I was tasked with building a comand-line application that takes in information about employees and then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

## Challenges and Successes
There are so many files to work with for this homework assignment. I found myself floating through each folder to determine which file was used for what. Testing is new, I am unclear on how to write a test as well as incorporate classes into my code. My biggest success was being able to colaborate with other students to understand various parts of the assignment.

## Technologies Used
Node.js  
NPM
